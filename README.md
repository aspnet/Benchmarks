# Benchmarks
A playground for experimenting with different server models.

# Environment
We're using the following physical machines to perform these tests:

| Name | OS | Role | CPU | RAM | NIC | Notes |
| ---- | --- | ---- | --- | --- | --- | ----- |
| perfsvr | Windows Server 2012 R2 | Web Server | [Xeon E5-1650](http://ark.intel.com/products/64601/Intel-Xeon-Processor-E5-1650-12M-Cache-3_20-GHz-0_0-GTs-Intel-QPI) | 32 GB | [Intel速 Ethernet Converged Network Adapter X540-T1 10GbE](http://ark.intel.com/products/58953/Intel-Ethernet-Converged-Network-Adapter-X540-T1) |
| perfsvr2 | Ubuntu 14.04 LTS | Web Server & Load Generator | [Xeon E5-1650](http://ark.intel.com/products/64601/Intel-Xeon-Processor-E5-1650-12M-Cache-3_20-GHz-0_0-GTs-Intel-QPI) | 32 GB | [Intel速 Ethernet Converged Network Adapter X540-T1 10GbE](http://ark.intel.com/products/58953/Intel-Ethernet-Converged-Network-Adapter-X540-T1) |
| perf02 | Windows Server 2012 R2 | Load Generator | [Xeon W3550](http://ark.intel.com/products/39720/Intel-Xeon-Processor-W3550-8M-Cache-3_06-GHz-4_80-GTs-Intel-QPI) | 24 GB | [Intel速 Ethernet Converged Network Adapter X540-T1 10GbE](http://ark.intel.com/products/58953/Intel-Ethernet-Converged-Network-Adapter-X540-T1) |
| perf03 | Ubuntu 14.04 LTS | Load Generator | [Xeon W3550](http://ark.intel.com/products/39720/Intel-Xeon-Processor-W3550-8M-Cache-3_06-GHz-4_80-GTs-Intel-QPI) | 12 GB | [Intel速 Ethernet Converged Network Adapter X540-T1 10GbE](http://ark.intel.com/products/58953/Intel-Ethernet-Converged-Network-Adapter-X540-T1) |

The machines are connected to an 8-port [Netgear XS708E](http://www.netgear.com/business/products/switches/unmanaged-plus/10g-plus-switch.aspx) 10-Gigabit switch.

# Load Generation
We're using [wrk](https://github.com/wg/wrk) to generate load from one of our Linux boxes (usually perfsvr2). We also have [WCAT](http://www.iis.net/downloads/community/2007/05/wcat-63-(x64)) set up on perf02 but it as it doesn't support HTTP pipelining we've stopped using it for now.

# Results
For each stack, variations of the load parameters and multiple runs are tested and the highest result is recorded. Detailed results are tracked in the [results spreadsheet](https://github.com/aspnet/benchmarks/blob/master/results/Results.xlsx).

## Experimental Baselines

These are server experiments that are intended to measure the non-HTTP overload of different technology stacks and approaches. These generally aren't real HTTP servers but rather TCP servers that special case replying to any HTTP-looking request with a fixed HTTP response.

| Stack | Server |  Req/sec | Load Params | Impl | Observations |
| ----- | ------ | -------- | ----------- | ---- | ------------ |
| Hammer (raw HTTP.SYS) | perfsvr | ~280,000 | 32 threads, 512 connections | C++ directly on HTTP.SYS | CPU is 100% |
| Hammer (raw HTTP.SYS) | perfsvr | ~460,000 | 32 threads, 256 connections, pipelining 16 deep | C++ directly on HTTP.SYS | CPU is 100% |
| libuv C# | perfsvr | 300,507 | 12 threads, 1024 connections | Simple TCP server, load spread across 12 ports (port/thread/CPU) | CPU is 54%, mostly in kernel mode |
| libuv C# | perfsvr | 2,379,267 | 36 threads, 288 connections, pipelining 16 deep | Simple TCP server, load spread across 12 ports (port/thread/CPU) | CPU is 100%, mostly in user mode |
| RIO C# | perfsvr | ~5,905,000 | 32 threads, 512 connections, pipelining 16 deep | Simple TCP server using Windows Registered IO (RIO) via P/Invoke from C# | CPU is 100%, 95% in user mode |

## Plain Text

Similar to the plain text benchmark in the TechEmpower tests. Intended to highlight the HTTP efficiency of the server & stack. Implementations are free to cache the response body aggressively and remove/disable components that aren't required in order to maximize performance.

| Stack | Server |  Req/sec | Load Params | Impl | Observations |
| ----- | ------ | -------- | ----------- | ---- | ------------ |
| ASP.NET 4.6 | perfsvr | 57,843 | 32 threads, 256 connections | Generic reusable handler, unused IIS modules removed | CPU is 100%, almost exclusively in user mode |
| IIS Static File (kernel cached) | perfsvr | 276,727 | 32 threads, 512 connections | hello.html containing "HelloWorld" | CPU is 36%, almost exclusively in kernel mode |
| IIS Static File (non-kernel cached) | perfsvr |231,609 | 32 threads, 512 connections | hello.html containing "HelloWorld" | CPU is 100%, almost exclusively in user mode |
| NodeJS | perfsvr | 102,730 | 32 threads, 256 connections | The actual TechEmpower NodeJS app | CPU is 100%, almost exclusively in user mode |
| ASP.NET 5 on Kestrel | perfsvr | 75,632 | 32 threads, 256 connections | Middleware class, single IO thread | CPU is 50% |
| Scala | perfsvr | 176,509 | 32 threads, 1024 connections | The actual TechEmpower Scala plain text app | CPU is 68%, mostly in kernel mode |

## Plain Text with HTTP Pipelining

Like the Plain Text scenario above but with HTTP pipelining enabled at a depth of 16. Only stacks/servers that show an improvement with pipelining are included.

| Stack | Server |  Req/sec | Load Params | Impl | Observations |
| ----- | ------ | -------- | ----------- | ---- | ------------ |
| NodeJS | perfsvr | 144,118 | 32 threads, 1024 connections | The actual TechEmpower NodeJS app | CPU is 100%, almost exclusively in user mode |
| ASP.NET 5 on Kestrel | perfsvr | 505,350 | 32 threads, 256 connections | Middleware class, single IO thread | CPU is 95%, 15-20% in kernel mode |
| ASP.NET 5 on Kestrel | perfsvr2 | 409,856 | 32 threads, 256 connections | Middleware class, single IO thread | CPU is 75% |
| Scala | perfsvr | 1,514,942 | 32 threads, 1024 connections | The actual TechEmpower Scala plain text app | CPU is 100%, 70% in user mode |
