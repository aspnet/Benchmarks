# Benchmarks
Benchmarks for ASP.NET Core including (but not limited to) scenarios from the [TechEmpower Web Framework Benchmarks](https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/).

The current results tracked by the ASP.NET team are available at [https://aka.ms/aspnet/benchmarks](https://aka.ms/aspnet/benchmarks).

# Setting up

These benchmark applications and docker images work best when used with [Microsoft Crank](https://github.com/dotnet/crank). Follow the instructions in the Crank repository in order to run the benchmarks on your own machines.

# Scenarios

The ASP.NET team runs all the scenarios in this repository as part of a continuous benchmarking effort.
The scenarios that are available to use with Crank and some sample command lines are available on [the scenarios page](https://github.com/aspnet/Benchmarks/tree/main/scenarios).
