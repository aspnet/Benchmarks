# Certificates

Certificate public-key length contributes to performant significantly, therefore there are 2 sets of certificates in corresponding directories ([2048 bit](./2048/) and [4096 bit](./4096/)).

Both directories have a `testCert.pfx` and `cert.pem`/`key.pem` (different certs, but same key-length).
