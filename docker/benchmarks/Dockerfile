# The ideal base image would be "microsoft/dotnet-nightly:2.1.0-preview1-runtime-deps-stretch".
# However, the wrk package is currently broken in "debian:stretch" (4.0.2-1+b1), but fixed in
# "debian:buster" (4.0.2-2).  For now, it's easier to use "debian:buster" as the base image and 
# manually install the .NET Core dependencies, rather than using "microsoft/dotnet-nightly" and
# compiling wrk from source.
